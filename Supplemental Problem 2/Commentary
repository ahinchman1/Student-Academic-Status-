Commentary

Numbered Listing of Circumstances:
 1) Objects could be null, but these have already been accounted for with
    the ability for a default constructor to be initialized.  The default 
    constructor can still go through the methods, although most of it would
    would be ignored.
 2) Objects could have an invalid amount of credits, which would cause 
    some credit counting problems, but should be covered by class 
    standing method. 
 3) Objects could be legitimate - they should work just fine.
